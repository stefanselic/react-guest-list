# Create a guest list app using React that allows for:

- [ ] Adding a guest using separate first name and last name fields
  - [ ] The first name input needs to have a related label containing `First name`
  - [ ] The last name input needs to have a related label containing `Last name`
  - [ ] A guest should be created upon pressing <kbd>Return</kbd> in the last name input
  - [ ] After a guest is created, both fields need to be cleared again
  - [ ] Newly created guests should be set as **not attending** by default
  - [ ] Each guest (all content and form fields) should be contained inside a div element with the attribute `data-test-id="guest"`
- [ ] Deleting a guest with a button that **either**:
  - [ ] Contains the text `Remove`
  - [ ] Has an `aria-label` attribute which starts with `Remove` (eg. `Remove <first name> <last name>`)
- [ ] Setting a guest as "attending" by clicking on a checkbox
  - [ ] The checkbox needs to have an `aria-label` which contains the text `attending` (eg. `<first name> <last name> attending status`) - the text can be uppercase or lowercase
  - [ ] On the first click of the attending checkbox, the guest needs to be set to attending (the checkbox needs to be checked)
  - [ ] On the second click of the attending checkbox, the guest needs to be set to not attending (the checkbox needs to be unchecked)
- [ ] Set up [this API](https://github.com/upleveled/express-guest-list-api-memory-data-store) and read the docs to understand how you can use it to store and retrieve data:
  - [ ] Save any changes to the API
  - [ ] Load the guest list from this API
- [ ] While the guest list is first loaded from the API (on page load):
  - [ ] Show a loading message containing the text `Loading...`
  - [ ] Disable the form fields

The default view should show all guests in the list.

Some features are similar to [this example](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) - check this out to see how the app should generally behave.

## Stretch TODOs

- [ ] Button to delete all attending guests
- [ ] Filters:
  - [ ] Filter to show only non-attending guests
  - [ ] Filter to show only attending guests
  - [ ] Button to reset filters to again show all of the guests
- [ ] Allow editing first and last names of existing guests
- [ ] Store the guest list permanently
  - [ ] Set up a database with either ElephantSQL (PostgreSQL) or Firebase Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)
  - [ ] Fork the API repo and change it to use the database
- [ ] Allow for saving an "attending deadline" with each guest and if the current date is later than that deadline (and the guest hasn't been set to "attending"), display the guest differently
- [ ] Change the frontend and the API to allow for creating multiple events, each with their own name, location, and guest list
- [ ] Convert your frontend code to TypeScript (see [Adding TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/))
- [ ] Create a favicon that identifies your app: (see [Generating and Adding Favicons](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-design-ux/#generating-and-adding-favicons))
- [ ] Right after [creating your first (empty) Git commit](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-command-line/#4-create-and-push-an-initial-commit), create a new branch. Use this branch to [open a pull request on GitHub](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#opening-pull-requests)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Preflight runs through without errors in your project
  - [ ] Link in your GitHub repo's About section: Netlify deployed website
- [ ] Project has been [imported into CodeSandbox](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#codesandbox) and a comment has been added below with the sandbox URL
- [ ] [Drone bot](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#upleveled-drone) has been tagged and responded with a passing message
- [ ] Correct GitHub commit message format (see [Writing Commit Messages](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#writing-commit-messages))

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
